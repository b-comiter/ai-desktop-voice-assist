                In some cases, black holes can even act as magnets, attracting other objects towards themselves while repelling other objects away.
                Black holes are considered one of the most complex phenomena in the universe, and their study is a major area of research in astrophysics and particle physics.
                Many theories and models have been proposed to explain how black holes form and interact with matter, and current scientific understanding of these phenomena continues to evolve as new discoveries are made.
